## Decription 

  

I am learning Laravel (PHP) programming for some time, so I started Laravel Tasks in order to continue learning programming in practice.  

CMS stands for [Content Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system).  

If also in the learning phase, this exercise could help you with the similar project.
